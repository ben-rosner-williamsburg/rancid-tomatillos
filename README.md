## Challenges:

Ben - Implementing responsive design and thorougly testing using Cypress was a challenge for me. Also dividing the work equally was a challenge

Zen - This was my first time working with React so understanding how React works was challenging since it was all so new to me

## Wins 

Ben - Figuring out how to manipulate props and states as well as understanding React and React Router was a win for me. Figuring out how to work through different time zones although not tecnical was also a win for me

Zen - Understanding how to manipulate props and states was a win for me as well as understanding how to conduct end to end testing with Cypress
